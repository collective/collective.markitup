There's lots to do!
===================

- Test and fix bugs in browsers, particularly since this product is currently only being tested in Firefox 4.
- Move the major configuration options to a configlet. Currently all hardcoded, mostly in javascript.
- The selectItem/Image browser is too slow. Make it faster or pick another one.
