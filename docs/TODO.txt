There's lots to do!
===================

- Test and fix bugs in browsers. While it seems to work in IE9, I'm pretty
  sure there's some IE7/8 unfriendly code in the init.js
- Move the major configuration options to a configlet. Currently all hardcoded, mostly in javascript.
- The selectItem/Image browser is too slow. Make it faster or pick another
  picker.
