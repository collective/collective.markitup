collective.markitup
============

0.1 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Depends on collective.plonefinder

 - Added a somewhat crappy way to apply the page styles to the preview.
   It's crappy, but it's faster that causing Plone to load a full-template page.

 - Used portal_url defined in plone_javascript_variables.js to find root path
   to objects.

 - Removed unneeded template.
 - Previewer can pick between reStructuredText, Markdown, Textile,
   (and HTML, which is a no-op).
 - Auto-loads based on chosen content-type.
 - Needed resources load on-the-fly, so very little needs to be in the Plone
   registries.
 - Added plugins for Textile and Rest as well as more robust HTML.
 - Simple, unobtrusive default look.

 - Added proof-of-concept AJAX preview view of Markdown transform.

   TinyMCE, I'm talking to you.
