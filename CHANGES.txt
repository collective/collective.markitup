============

0.1 - Unreleased
----------------

 - Improved preview styles by adding <div id="content"/> around the
   content to be previewed.
   [msmith64]

 - Improved preview styles even more so that they don't need HTTP requests.
   Now the only crappiness is the amount of Javascript needed to get it done.
   [msmith64]

 - Improved preview styles so loading them isn't quite as crappy.
   Still crappy though
 - Some cleanup/whitespace pedantry
   [msmith64]

 - Depends on collective.plonefinder
   [msmith64]

 - Added a somewhat crappy way to apply the page styles to the preview.
   It's crappy, but it's faster that causing Plone to load a full-template
   page.

 - Used portal_url defined in plone_javascript_variables.js to find root path
   to objects.
   [msmith64]
 
 - Removed unneeded template.
 - Previewer can pick between reStructuredText, Markdown, Textile,
   (and HTML, which is a no-op).
 - Auto-loads based on chosen content-type.
 - Needed resources load on-the-fly, so very little needs to be in the Plone
   registries.
 - Added plugins for Textile and Rest as well as more robust HTML.
 - Simple, unobtrusive default look.
   [msmith64]

 - Added proof-of-concept AJAX preview view of Markdown transform.
   [msmith64]

 - Tweaked GS profile so that user preferences are respected.
   TinyMCE, I'm talking to you.
   [msmith64]

 - Added MarkItUp JQuery plugin and registered resources in basic GS profile.
   [msmith64]

 - Added MarkItUp to available editors in control panel.
   [msmith64]

 - Initial setup
